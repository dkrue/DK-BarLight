# DK-BarLight
I made an Arduino based animated LED backlight for my home bar. 
## How it works
The light is activated when the lid of the bar is opened by a magnetic reed switch sensor, which kicks off a cool _reveal_ effect. I recreated a warm white color with standard RGB LEDs, which do a subtle breathing effect. After a while the light cascades to red, and back again.
## Ingredients
- This was made using an inexpensive Pro Micro board, your standard 5050 LED strip (28 LEDs), a magnetic reed swtich, a tiny  upcycled magnet from an old Macbook.
